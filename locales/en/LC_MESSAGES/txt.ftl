new-wallet = You don't have a wallet attached yet!
              To deposit and withdraw <b>AZOTH</b> you need to link your TON wallet
              allowing you to work with <b>Jettons</b>
              and authorization through Mnemonics, for example <b>Telegram Wallet</b> - TON Space
              or <b>TonKeeper</b>
              If you don’t have a wallet yet, create one on the website!
              https://tonkeeper.com/
              If you already have a wallet, link it using
              addresses (example: UQDIkS1d_Lhd7EDttTtcmr9Xzg78uEMDEsYFde-PZCgfoOtU)
              and Mnemonics (a list of 24 words that were given when creating the wallet)

              It is <b>Safer</b> to use a wallet that you do not use for the main
              storage of funds, we recommend creating a new one,
              because if someone intercepts your <b>Mnemonics</b>,
              he will be able to send transactions on your behalf and steal 💳 facilities!
              Also, for <b>security</b> purposes,
              you can use different wallets to deposit and withdraw AZOTH from the game.
              To do this, enter the Address of the wallet to which
              you will transfer AZOTH (safe), and enter <b>Mnemonics</b>
              from another wallet (which you won't mind🫣)

              First copy the Wallet Address and send it to the chat
new-mnemonics = Great!
